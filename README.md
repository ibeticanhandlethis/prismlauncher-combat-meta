# prismlauncher-combat-meta
This repository is created for combat tests only and created to make fixes to things that don't work
## To-do
1. Fix Fabric Intermediary
2. Fix Fabric

As a matter of fact, if installing fabric with original metarepo and don't install fabric api it says install fabric, when fabric api is installed it dies for no reason.
